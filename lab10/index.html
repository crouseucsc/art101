     <h2>Challenges</h2>
     <p>The challenge within this lab was to create an input field within the
       webpage without the need to be interrupted with a prompt/pop-up.
       Initially, it was hard to understand, but through meticulously reviewing
       the course material it was able to be grasped. Retaining the information
       will be the next challenge.</p>
     <h2>Problems</h2>
     <p>There were no serious issues when creating this assignment as I
       approached this assignment very slowly and never attempting to rush ahead.
       Aside from the missing image errors present in the consoles, nothing
       completely broke.</p>
     <h2>Results</h2>
