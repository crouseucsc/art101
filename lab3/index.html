	<h1>Lab 3: File Structures</h1>
	<p>The purpose of this lab is to creat an organized file structure within your harddrive for future uses of labs.</p>
	<h1>Challenges</h1>
	<p>Challenges may occur when trying to upload changes that have been made from any number of files up to github, as changes may take upwards of 5 minutes before they are visible and making troubleshooting much more difficult.</p>
	<h1>Results</h1>
	<p>If you can see this, then it is super meta as what you are looking at is Lab 3. An assignment meant to oragnize assignments including itself. Below is an image of my local file structure, although on PC you can only open so much and display so much, rest assured all files are present.</p>
