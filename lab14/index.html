    <h1>Lab 14: Debugging Tools and Strategies</h1>
    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>The challenge of this lab is to review preview labs and essentially clean up the files to eliminate unnecessary elements or errors that may have occurred.</p>
    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>When I approach any lab I am fairly thorough at making sure that everything functions the way the lab asks for as far as I can understand without having any errors in the console. Typically, the console errors only happen when there is an image that I have referenced that hasn't been imported yet or a file that hasn't been created. In most cases, it's just a matter of relabelling or deleting references that were not needed in the final product.</p>
    <h2>Results/Assignment Prompt</h2>
    <p>The majority of changes were mere reconstructions and eliminating redundancies.</p>
    <h3>Task 1: Create an HTML file</h3>

    <h3>Task 2: Debug Old Labs</h3>
    <p>Below is an image from the HTML file of my homepage (Lab 0?), there were no errors in the code, however, I took mental notes at the beginning of the quarter to delete a CSS reference that was unnecessary and rename the current helloworld.css to be more accurate, this is after the change, however. A cleanup of files.</p>

    <p>Below is an image of the index of Lab 3. Again, I rid of the redundant CSS and also changed some of the labelings.</p>

    <p>Below is an image of Lab 6 demonstrating an egregious example of redundant CSS files. These have been removed and the site still functions as intended.</p>
