    <h1>Lab 9: JavaScript for the Web.</h1>
     <h2>Challenges</h2>
     <p>The challenges I face were to try and understand what specific function does document.create and document.get accomplish and not having visual feedback to decipher.</p>
     <h2>Problems</h2>
     <p>Problems occurred when trying to accomplish task 2, where it states "Change the html attribute of new1El to say something new" as this was rather vague but also broad. There were no visual examples to assist with this but through some research I found that using .innerHTML did exactly that, as simply changing text in the HTML file seemed far too simplistic for a new assignment. Howveer I am still uncertain if this is what we were supposed to do as .innerHTML is not mentioned in the prompt. and I am also still uncertain what implementing this code does aside from displaying text no better or any diffreently than typical HTML text.</p>
     <h2>Results</h2>
      <h3>Task 1: Create an index.html for Lab 9</h3>
      <p>Here is the early stages of the HTML file.</p>
