    <h1>Lab 15: AJAX</h1>
    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>The challenge in this lab is to use a compatible code using sources from a third party to draw information from them, similar to a search engine.</p>
    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>!!Critical Note!! 3/8/2021</p>
    <p>GitHub is having some compatability issues with this lab. I have a attempted multiple reuploads and renaming. I am uncertain as to why I am repeatedly getting error 404 on mulltiple images and files. Everything has been labelled correctly. As you may see below, there is a screencap of it working on the server, this was only temporary as I have made no significant changes to affect this assignment. This same lab was also used as a template for the next lab, which functions flawlessly. This lab also works without error running locally, it is only throuhg GitHub that it malfunctions. I have come to the conslusion that this on GitHub's end.</p>
    <p>Aside from some typos, there were no real issues. However, when trying to implement a way to display an image in the output of whatever was searched, I could not seem to find why the image source was undefined. Either it would result in the code not executing at all, or it would display an icon for a blank image. I decided to just omit this feature until I could figure out what was going on. </p>
    <h2>Results</h2>

    <h3>Task 4: Test, Debug, and Upload</h3>
    <p>This is an example of the image code that was not getting caught. This was out of my understanding as to what was going on. Multiple adjustments and iterations showed no results.</p>
