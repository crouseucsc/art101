					<h5>Student</h5>
					<h5>Major, Arts in Games and Playable Media</h5>
					<h5>University of California, Santa Cruz</h5>
					<h5>Associate, Animation and Game Design</h5>
					<h5>Diablo Valley College</h5>

						<p>Christian Rouse is an Antioch, California-based Arts in Games and Playable Media student currently working towards his bachelor’s degree. He has been active academically since the Fall of 2013 while he was still a senior in high school where he first attended Los Medanos College for his first few years of community college. Intent on pursuing Game Design, Christian later found that Los Medanos College did not offer any academic program to acquire a degree and game design, and instead registered under the fine arts that he aimlessly endured for four years. After four years, Christian later found that the neighboring Diablo Valley College (DVC) under the same district (Contra Costa Community College District) did offer an academic program to pursue game design, which counselors just so happen to never mention in the years he was attending Los Medanos College. Christian immediately went to work on an Animation and Game Design degree after he had started attending Diablo Valley College. Within two years, Christian completed all the requirements for the Animation and Game Design Degree as well as nearly all curriculum required to transfer to a University of California. By 2019, after spending approximately six years as a full-time student pursuing a two-year degree at two different community colleges and one college extension. Christian was finally accepted to one of the very few UCs that had a game design program, UC Santa Cruz. Unfortunately, yet again another hurdle, UCSC would only accept transfer students proposing their Animation and Game Design program during the Fall of 2020. Christian instead proposed Theater Arts which was accepting students beginning Winter of 2020. This, he saw, was an opportunity to get a head start in the AGPM program as what University or College does not let you change your major once you begin attending? Christian’s plan worked, he packed all his essential belongings and moved 70 miles south to UCSC where he attended courses that were requirements for AGPM majors. He cheated the system. However, the system the DoE created does not like being cheated and outsmarted as intelligence equals success, and success equates to less money for them. After attending only one quarter at UCSC, he was bombarded with holds and penalties ranging from medical records to not adhering to the academic plan UCSC set up (which USCS just so happen to never mention). On top of this, there was a worldwide pandemic in its infancy and it was no longer financially viable to be attending the Santa Cruz campus. Once again, he packed his belongings and moved to the ghettos of Antioch, California. Since then the University of California has been making a constant effort that Christian is banned from taking required courses or to make sure to overcharge him with penalties at any given opportunity because he is not following the academic plan that they intended for him to "succeed" even though Christian's custom academic plan would result in graduation six months earlier than intended. The only consequence to this is that UCSC wouldn't be able to charge him an additional five figures to have him attend, and of course, UCSC can't let that happen. Even with UCSC efforts, Christian compiled files and emails for a lawsuit against them and is still ahead on his requirements, even though UCSC has partially succeeded in pushing his intended completion three months back, he is still ahead by three months (originally six). Currently, he is fighting a penalty from UCSC that claims that unless given circumstances, he must provide evidence that he is a part-time student, else face a full-tuition bill that a full-time student normally has. Unfortunately, one of the core requirement courses currently conflicts with any other combination of two requirements (either elective or core). So he had no choice but to only have two classes or the option of wasting time and money on a third course that either met no requirement or one that was already completed. He still is fighting against UCSC’s exploitation of their TAs and students after a year of attending. If you have read this far, I applaud you for enduring my rant against the University educational industry complex.</p>
