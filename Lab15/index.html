    <h1>Lab 15: AJAX</h1>
    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>The challenge in this lab is to use a compatible code using sources from a third party to draw information from them, similar to a search engine.</p>
    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>Aside from some typos, there were no real issues. However, when trying to implement a way to display an image in the output of whatever was searched, I could not seem to find why the image source was undefined. Either it would result in the code not executing at all, or it would display an icon for a blank image. I decided to just omit this feature until I could figure out what was going on. </p>
    <h2>Results</h2>

    <h3>Task 4: Test, Debug, and Upload</h3>
    <p>This is an example of the image code that was not getting caught. This was out of my understanding as to what was going on. Multiple adjustment and iterations showed no results.</p>
