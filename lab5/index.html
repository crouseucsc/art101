		<h1>Lab 5: Data Types and Variables</h1>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>This is not my first time with Javascript nor HTML as previously I had taken Data Structures for Interactive Media with Adam Smith my first quarter at UCSC. Thus, none of this have proven challenging. I know that it's about to change though.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>I am thankful for my previous experience, I have yet to run into any technical issues as of typing this aside from getting the Javascript output to function.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>Below is the file execution requested of the lab rubric.</p>
		<h2>Script Output</h2>
