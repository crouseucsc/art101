			<p>2. Select joints.</p>
			<p>3. Use either the rotation or move tools to move part of the avatar.</p>
			<p>4. Move part to desired coordinates.</p>
			<p>5. Set a keyframe to lock it into position.</p>

			<p>7. Repeat process from step 1.</p>
			
<pre>//Create timeline in frames-per-second.
  //determine how many frames per second will be used and for how long.
//Create joints on the rigged avatar.
  //Create rigged joints or point selections.
    //Research how to set certain pixels to be selectors.
      //Set functions for move and roate tools.
//Insert x, y,and z cooridantes to determine destination of joint.
  //Once at destination, note again the cooridinates and save destination in timeline.
    //Scrub or scroll through current animation
      //If any inconsistencies, refer back to the x, y, and z coordinates.
//Loop through animation.
  //Beginning from first keyframe.
    //Make loop indefinite.</pre>
